# Austin Osman Spare Sigil Generator

This is a sigil generator based on the principles of occultist and artist Austin Osman Spare. Sigils are graphical representations of desires or intentions created using the letters of a phrase.

# Free Demo

You can find a free demo of this generator on [Austin Osman Spare Sigil Generator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cha0smagick/Austin_osman_spare_sigil_generator).

## How it works

The program takes a phrase entered by the user, omits the vowels and repeated letters, shuffles the remaining letters randomly, and visualizes them in a unique glyph. This glyph is generated using a Fibonacci spiral to distribute the letters in an aesthetically pleasing way.
